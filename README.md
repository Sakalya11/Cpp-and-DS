# EXP 1

## Aim:
 To demonstrate the basic structure of a C++ program and the syntax for outputting text to the console.

### Theory:
 The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional first exercise in learning any programming language, demonstrating the basic syntax and structure of a C++ program. In C++, the `#include` directive is used to import the standard input-output stream library, enabling the use of `std::cout` for outputting text to the console. The `main` function acts as the entry point of every C++ program. Within the `main` function, `std::cout << "Hello, World!";` outputs the string "Hello, World!" to the console, followed by `std::endl` which inserts a newline. This program introduces fundamental concepts such as headers, namespaces, the `main` function, and output statements.

### Apparatus:
 VS Code, Github

### Conclusion:
 The "Hello World!" program serves as an essential introduction to C++ programming. It demonstrates fundamental concepts like including libraries, using namespaces, and outputting text. By executing this simple program, learners gain a foundational understanding of C++ syntax

# EXP 2

## Aim:
  To perform basic arithmetic operations and number classifications by calculating the sum, average, and determining whether numbers are even or odd.

### Theory:

### Arithmetic Operations:
Basic arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are performed using operators like +, -, *, and /. The program calculates the sum and average of a series of numbers, demonstrating how to perform and combine arithmetic operations.

### Conditional Statements:
Conditional operators are used to make decisions in the program. For instance, the modulus operator % is used to determine if a number is even or odd. Conditional statements such as if and else help in branching the program flow based on whether the condition is true or false.

### Input/Output Operations:
The program uses std::cin to take input from the user and std::cout to display output. This interaction is essential for creating dynamic programs that can handle user-provided data.


### Apparatus:
 VS Code, Github

### Conclusion:
The program offers hands-on experience with core C++ concepts, such as arithmetic operations and conditional logic. By performing calculations and classifying numbers, users gain insight into essential programming techniques and handling user input efficiently. This exercise aids in mastering basic computations and decision-making in C++.
