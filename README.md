#EXP 1

##Aim:
To demonstrate the basic structure of a C++ program and the syntax for outputting text to the console.

##Theory:
The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional first exercise in learning any programming language, demonstrating the basic syntax and structure of a C++ program. In C++, the `#include` directive is used to import the standard input-output stream library, enabling the use of `std::cout` for outputting text to the console. The `main` function acts as the entry point of every C++ program. Within the `main` function, `std::cout << "Hello, World!";` outputs the string "Hello, World!" to the console, followed by `std::endl` which inserts a newline. This program introduces fundamental concepts such as headers, namespaces, the `main` function, and output statements.

##Apparatus:
VS Code, Github

##Conclusion:
The "Hello World!" program serves as an essential introduction to C++ programming. It demonstrates fundamental concepts like including libraries, using namespaces, and outputting text. By executing this simple program, learners gain a foundational understanding of C++ syntax
