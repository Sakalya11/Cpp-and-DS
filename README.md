# EXP 1

## Aim:
  To get started with C++ programming, first write a simple "Hello World" program using std::cout to display the message. Next, create a program to calculate and display the sum and average of two user-input numbers. For checking if a number is even or odd, use the modulo operator to determine if the number is divisible by 2. Lastly, write a program to check if a given year is a leap year by testing if the year is divisible by 4, and if divisible by 100, also by 400.

### Theory:
 "Hello World" and other introductory programs serve as a means to grasp the fundamental syntax of C++ and familiarize oneself with its standard library. These initial programs aid programmers in learning basic input/output functions, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements. They are crucial for gaining an understanding of fundamental data types, variables, and operators used in C++.

### Conclusion:
  These basic programs serve as introductory exercises for understanding the fundamental structure and syntax of C++. Through these exercises, we learn to utilize input/output commands, as well as arithmetic and logical operators, and conditional statements.










# EXP 2

## Aim:
  To perform basic arithmetic operations and number classifications by calculating the sum, average, and determining whether numbers are even or odd.

### Theory:

### Arithmetic Operations:
Basic arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are performed using operators like +, -, *, and /. The program calculates the sum and average of a series of numbers, demonstrating how to perform and combine arithmetic operations.

### Conditional Statements:
Conditional operators are used to make decisions in the program. For instance, the modulus operator % is used to determine if a number is even or odd. Conditional statements such as if and else help in branching the program flow based on whether the condition is true or false.

### Input/Output Operations:
The program uses std::cin to take input from the user and std::cout to display output. This interaction is essential for creating dynamic programs that can handle user-provided data.


### Apparatus:
 VS Code, Github

### Conclusion:
The program offers hands-on experience with core C++ concepts, such as arithmetic operations and conditional logic. By performing calculations and classifying numbers, users gain insight into essential programming techniques and handling user input efficiently. This exercise aids in mastering basic computations and decision-making in C++.
